# rust-ci-conf
Collection of CI configuration files for Rust projects
I have stolen it from https://github.com/jonhoo :D

## The idea
The idea is to apply this Rust CI configuration for my Microservice Project with RSCP protocol.
I would like to keep all dependencies of this project uptodate and have some testing environment.

TestString for CI merge
